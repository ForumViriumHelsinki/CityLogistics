      <h3 class="text-center m-3">Open Logistics Map - OLMap</h3>
      <h4 class="text-center m-3">Collection process for map data</h4>
      <p>
        The OLMap data collection tool has been developed to help improve OSM data on features of interest to
        logistics companies, especially entrances, gates and other barriers. It is designed for data collection
        "in the field" using a smartphone, and subsequent data processing using a computer and the iD OSM editor.
        It may also be used as a more general map commenting & data collection tool. It enables:
        <ul>
          <li>Collecting points of interest on the map, in the form of images and/or textual notes.</li>
          <li>Linking the collected notes to nearby OSM features (entrances, barriers, addresses, named features such as companies & streets)</li>
          <li>Categorizing the notes by the type of information documented (e.g. entrance, barrier, problem)</li>
          <li>Entering the most relevant OSM tags related to the documented features (e.g. wheelchair access, opening hours, number of steps)</li>
          <li>Serving the notes as a GeoJSON dataset to support OSM editing by layering on top of the iD edit view</li>
          <li>Exporting the entered tags as a text blob directly copyable to the iD tags input field.</li>
        </ul>
        The remainder of this document will go into detail as to how these different goals are achieved.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-5">User roles</h5>
      <p>
        There are currently two roles of significance to data collection in OLMap - <b>user</b> and <b>reviewer</b>.
        Users can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create new map notes, categorize them, relate to OSM features, and add OSM tags for them.</li>
        <li>Comment on, and up/downvote existing notes, but <b>not edit or delete them</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to that, reviewers can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Edit the categories, OSM feature links and OSM tags of existing notes.</li>
        <li>Export the entered tags as a text blob directly copyable to the iD tags input field.</li>
        <li>Mark notes as accepted or rejected; rejecting notes will make them invisible to all users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently, the process to become a reviewer is to contact <b>johan.lindqvist@forumvirium.fi</b>.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-5">Adding an image note to the map</h5>

      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/1-notes-view.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The notes view (which is the default view for most users) shows the user's position on the map,
        as detected by the device's location sensors. The view offers four action buttons on the top right; in order:
        <ul>
          <li>Take a photo</li>
          <li>Make a textual map note</li>
          <li>Reload notes on map</li>
          <li>Limit notes shown to my own notes</li>
        </ul>
        By tapping on the photo action, the device camera is activated to take a new photo:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/2-take-picture.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Once you are happy with the photo, the system will request the exact position of the pictured feature.
        Use surrounding features on the map background to pinpoint the location:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/3-select-position.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        When you have selected the location, OLMap will search for nearby OSM features of interest and allow you
        to link the note to one or more existing features. Point features have a location button showing a popup of
        the location of the feature relative to your new note. Select any features directly related to the subject of
        the note:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/4-choose-related.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Now, OLMap will allow you to enter a free text description for the note; you can also tag it to mark
        the intention of the note. Most tags are associated with a particular type of OSM feature; selecting the tag
        allows you to then enter more specific information on that feature. This may in some cases be
        more convenient to do later with a computer, given that the relevant information is visible in the picture
        or the free text description:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/5-comment-and-tag.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        When all the relevant information has been entered in the field, tap the Done button in the very bottom
        of the active window. A verification notice on successful save should be shown:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/7-save-note.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Now the new note is visible as a circle on the map to you and all other users of the system. Reviewers
        will see the new note as orange (as opposed to green) to highlight that it has not yet been
        reviewed and added to OSM:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/8-note-saved.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Tapping on the note on the map will open a popup showing the information as entered. Pictured
        here is the view as shown to a reviewer user; some features are only shown to reviewers:
        <ul>
          <li>The OSM / Accept / Reject actions for OSM editing & note reviewing</li>
          <li>The opportunity to change the tags after note creation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/9-view-saved-note.jpg"/>



      <h5 class="mt-5">Documenting stairs</h5>
      <p>
        Choosing the steps tag allows you to enter basic information on the stairs that would be relevant
        for someone planning to use them while delivering a package:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/6-steps-info.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Once the note has been saved, reviewers are provided with the option to copy the given OSM tags
        as one text field for transfer to OSM via the iD editor:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/10-note-as-osm-tags.jpg"/>




      <h5 class="mt-5">Documenting entrances</h5>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/14-entrance-note-saved.jpg"/>
      <p class="mt-5">
        When documenting an entrance, the process starts as described in <b>Adding an image note to the map</b> above.
        After tagging the note as an entrance, the <b>New Entrance</b> button appears; tapping it gives you the
        opportunity to add entrance-specific fields:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/13-entrance-details.jpg"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        When opening a saved image note, tapping on the image zooms in to the tapped point; this can be useful
        especially when documenting texts and other essential details around entrances:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/16-zoom-image.jpg"/>



      <h5 class="mt-5">Documenting companies and services</h5>
      <p>
        The <b>shop</b>, <b>amenity</b> and <b>office</b> tags give you the opportunity to input information
        relevant to companies reachable through the documented entrances:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/15-shop-details.jpg"/>


      <h5 class="mt-5">Editing OSM with iD and OLMap</h5>

      <p>
        After collecting the data in the field, it can be refined and integrated into OSM. It is recommendded to use
        a computer with a large screen for this; the process is generally most efficient if you have space to open
        OLMap and iD side by side.
      </p>

      <p>
        When opening a newly saved note on the map, reviewers are provided with an <b>OSM</b> button in the top
        left corner; clicking the button will open the iD editor in a new browser window, zoomed in to the location
        of the open OLMap note:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 img md-img shadow-lg" style="max-width: 640px" src="images/editing-process/17-open-osm.png"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        After opening iD, it is recommended to move & resize the OLMap & iD windows to a side-by-side scheme.
        Then, open the <b>Data layers</b> -> <b>Custom map data</b> option in the iD side menu and enter the url
        <b>https://api.olmap.org/rest/osm_image_notes.geojson</b> :
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 m-2 shadow-lg img" src="images/editing-process/18-osm-id-data-layer.png"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Now, OLMap image notes should show as pink circles on the map in the iD editor:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/19-notes-in-id-editor.png"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        To get the documented tags into OSM, a reviewer can copy all the tags for one feature from OLMap in
        the format expected by the iD tags input field:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/20-copy-tags-from-olmap.png"/>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img" src="images/editing-process/21-tags-in-id-editor.png"/>

      <p class="mt-5">
        When adding new point features with this process, it is most efficient to just choose Point as the type;
        the more specific type will be automatically recognized from the fields copied from OLMap:
      </p>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img"  src="images/editing-process/23-new-point-for-entrance-in-id-editor.png"/>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img mobile-img"  src="images/editing-process/24-copy-entrance-tags.png"/>
      <img class="w-100 m-2 shadow-lg" src="images/editing-process/25-entrance-tags-in-id-editor.png"/>


      <h5 class="mt-5">Linking newly created features & entrances</h5>
      <p>
        Once a changeset with new features created from OLMap notes has been committed to OSM, one more step is
        recommended; linking the newly created OSM features back to the OLMap notes, and explicitly linking any newly
        created companies and entrances with each other. The purpose of this is to allow e.g. OLMap-aware OSM-based
        navigation apps to display relavant OLMap notes for OSM-based routes, and to recommend the correct entrance
        when routing to a company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linking new features to notes is achieved with the <b>Related places</b> section in the UI, in the same way as
        any original related features were selected when creating the note. When listing entrances in the related
        places list, an additional <b>link button</b> is shown; clicking the button opens a separate list of
        possible companies to link to the entrance. Select any companies reachable using the selected entrance:
      </p>

      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img md-img" src="images/editing-process/29-link-entrance-button.png"/>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img md-img" src="images/editing-process/30-link-entrance-window.png"/>

      <h5 class="mt-5">Marking notes as reviewed</h5>
      <p>
        Once all needed changes to OSM suggested by the note have been made, and the new features have been linked back,
        the note can be marked as reviewed; reviewed notes will show up as green on the map to reviewers, allowing
        easy distinction between processed and unprocessed notes. Marking the note as reviewed happens by clicking the
        <b>Accept</b> button on the top of the note window; upon accepting, the note changes color on the map:
      </p>

      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img md-img" src="images/editing-process/31-accept-entrance-note.png"/>
      <img class="w-100 shadow-lg img md-img mb-5" src="images/editing-process/32-notes-accepted-and-done.png"/>
